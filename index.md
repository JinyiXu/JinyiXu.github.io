## About Me

Nice to meet you!

My name is Jinyi Xu, and I am currently a senior at Lehigh University, pursuing dual degrees in finance and mathematics. I have been actively involved in various projects that enhance my data analysis skills in Lehigh University. In 2022, I also had the opportunity to intern at KPMG China as a technical consultant.

In my free time, I enjoy singing and dancing. I joined the Lehigh University Choir in my freshman year and have participated in several dance clubs throughout my time at Lehigh.

_**[Fin377-NLP of 10-K Reports Project](report.md)**_

This report delves into the risk factors in 10-K filings using advanced natural language processing technologies. It includes parsing the file paths of 10-K documents to retrieve data and conducting sentiment analysis on the report content. Through this analysis, we can deeply understand the latent risks in financial disclosures and evaluate the positive and negative discussions surrounding key topics, showcasing the potential of NLP to transform traditional financial analysis.
