## About Me

Nice to meet you!

My name is Jinyi Xu, and I am currently a senior at Lehigh University, pursuing dual degrees in finance and mathematics. I have been actively involved in various projects that enhance my data analysis skills in Lehigh University. In 2022, I also had the opportunity to intern at KPMG China as a technical consultant.

In my free time, I enjoy singing and dancing. I joined the Lehigh University Choir in my freshman year and have participated in several dance clubs throughout my time at Lehigh.
